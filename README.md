# EE 306

This repository contains the programming assignments I completed for Dr. Yerraballi's EE 306 Introduction to Computing course at the University of Texas at Austin. I took this course during the Fall 2020 semester. In the class, I was able to learn about different number representations (binary & hexadecimal), transistors, logic gates, combinational & sequential logic circuits, memory, and finite state machines. In the class, we used the LC3 ISA, so I was able to learn about LC3 Assembly instructions, addressing modes, instruction set, machine code, and assemblers. By completing programming assignments using LC3 Assembly, I was able to learn about introductory data structures, I/O, TRAPs, subroutines, and interrupts.  

## Disclaimer
If you are taking the course right now, PLEASE don't copy my code. These programming assignments are great to learn the concepts of the class and very useful to try and implement on your own. There's no point in taking the class if you aren't going to take the time to learn the material and do the assignments. I put this repository on GitHub solely for the purpose of having a collection of my code/programming assignments and for resume purposes. It is never my intention to provide cheats for current students, and I suggest that you don't cheat your educational experience either.
